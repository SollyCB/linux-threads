Hey! I just sent an email to your public inbox, but I wanted to send you
another personally to say how grateful I am to experienced programmers
like yourself who release useful resources for newer people like me to
learn from.

I am self-taught, so I completely rely on online resources and books to
get an understanding of low-level software, and without guys like you,
it would be infinitely harder to keep learning.

It really is inspiring to read blog posts like yours [1], as they
demonstrate a level of understanding and experience which I also aim to
achieve.

I doubt you would ever want to check out any of my stuff, but I will
link my two best projects in case you ever want to take a look.
Hopefully they demonstrate that the information that people like you
release for free really helps and inspires less experienced people like
me to work on projects that they find interesting and useful.

My Vulkan rendering engine (some of the source will look a little ugly
as I was much less experienced while I was working on it, but the
outcome I think is still pretty cool):

My C single header general library, inspired by stb.h (note that I
rewrote it from scratch a few weeks ago since my old one was getting
crufty, so some of the implementations are a bit funky as they have not
been thoroughly tested on real projects yet in order to iron everything
out, one example being the arena).
